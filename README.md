# Webscraping-using-beautifulsoup

using oop, i are going tp be scraping a website. the website is wikipedia which is a static weboite.there are two kinds of scrapping when it comes to a website. It can either be a static website or a dynamic website. With the latter being more complex. Nowadays most webites are dynamic. we will be using methods from beautifulsoup and request python libraries


to begin the webscrapping, i imported three modules which are pandas, BeautifulSoup and requests. The BeautifulSoup module helps in webscraping and the requests helps to download a webpage. I downloaded the contents of the webpage in text format and stored it in a variable called response. I created a soup object using the the variable 'response'
